# Implementation Plan: Enhanced React Calculator

## Project Overview
This document outlines the plan for enhancing a React Calculator application with three major features using Aider, an AI pair programming tool.

## Selected Project
**React Calculator**: A basic calculator application built with React that provides standard arithmetic operations.

## Feature 1: Calculation History

### User Story
As a user, I want to see a history of my calculations so I can refer back to previous work and reuse past calculations.

### Technical Requirements
1. Create a collapsible history panel component that displays past calculations
2. Store calculation history in state and persist in local storage
3. Implement functionality to recall history items when clicked
4. Add clear history option
5. Ensure history persists across browser sessions

### Files to Modify
- `src/App.js` - Add history state and storage logic
- `src/components/Calculator.js` - Integrate history functionality
- New file: `src/components/History.js` - Create history panel component
- CSS files for styling the history panel

### Implementation Steps
1. Create basic History component structure
2. Add history state management in App component
3. Implement local storage persistence
4. Create UI for displaying history items
5. Add click handlers for history recall
6. Style the history panel with toggle functionality
7. Add clear history button

### Potential Challenges
- Managing state updates without side effects
- Ensuring proper history format for display and recall
- Handling edge cases (empty history, overflow)
- Managing component layout with the additional panel

## Feature 2: Theme Switching

### User Story
As a user, I want to switch between light and dark themes for better visibility in different environments and personal preference.

### Technical Requirements
1. Create theme toggle component with icon indication
2. Implement light and dark theme CSS variables
3. Store theme preference in local storage
4. Apply theme changes throughout the application
5. Add smooth transitions between themes

### Files to Modify
- `src/App.js` - Add theme context/state
- `src/styles/` - Modify CSS files to use theme variables
- New file: `src/components/ThemeToggle.js` - Create toggle component
- New file: `src/contexts/ThemeContext.js` - Create theme context

### Implementation Steps
1. Set up theme context and provider
2. Create CSS variables for both themes
3. Build theme toggle component with icon
4. Implement local storage for theme persistence
5. Add transition effects for smooth theme switching
6. Test across all components

### Potential Challenges
- Ensuring consistent styling across all components
- Managing theme-specific styles for new components
- Handling initial theme loading without flicker
- Accessibility considerations for both themes

## Feature 3: Scientific Calculator Mode

### User Story
As a user, I want to access advanced scientific functions when needed, while keeping the basic calculator simple for everyday use.

### Technical Requirements
1. Add toggle for scientific mode
2. Implement scientific functions (sin, cos, tan, log, sqrt, etc.)
3. Expand UI when in scientific mode
4. Maintain calculation history functionality with scientific operations

### Files to Modify
- `src/components/Calculator.js` - Add scientific mode toggle and functions
- `src/utils/calculations.js` - Implement scientific calculation logic
- CSS files - Add styles for scientific mode layout

### Implementation Steps
1. Create scientific mode toggle button
2. Implement UI changes for scientific mode
3. Add scientific operation buttons
4. Implement calculation logic for scientific functions
5. Update display formatting for scientific results
6. Integrate with history functionality
7. Add appropriate error handling for operations like division by zero

### Potential Challenges
- Managing complex calculation order and precedence
- Handling display of large/small numbers in scientific notation
- UI space constraints for additional buttons
- Testing edge cases for scientific calculations

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Test each calculation function independently
   - Verify history storage and retrieval
   - Test theme persistence
   - Validate scientific calculations

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Verify history integration with calculator operations
   - Test theme application across all components
   - Validate scientific mode toggle and integration with basic calculator

3. **User Testing**:
   - Test UI/UX for intuitiveness
   - Verify responsiveness and layout in different screen sizes
   - Test accessibility with screen readers

## Git Workflow
1. Create a main development branch from master
2. Create feature branches for each major feature:
   - `feature/calculation-history`
   - `feature/theme-switching`
   - `feature/scientific-mode`
3. Commit incremental changes within each feature branch
4. Merge completed features back to development branch
5. Create pull request to master when all features are completed and tested

## Timeline Estimate
- Project setup and familiarization: 30 minutes
- Feature 1 (History): 1-1.5 hours
- Feature 2 (Theme): 1 hour
- Feature 3 (Scientific mode): 1.5-2 hours
- Testing and refinement: 1 hour
- Documentation: 1 hour

Total estimated time: 6-7 hours
